			<div style="font-size: 15px;">by swirln</div>
			
			<p style="max-width: 800px;">
				This guide shows you how to unpatch one of the many methods of RCE on clients that have it badly patched. This guide is pretty useless because if your peers don't have RCE unpatched then you can't do anything.
				<ol>
					<li>Open up the client in a debugger</li>
					<li>Search for "ioEnabled" in the current module</li>
					<li>If it's badly patched there should be a "ret" and a "nop" a few lines up.</li>
					<li>Change the "ret" to "push 0x4"</li>
					<li>Patch the client and you're done!</li>
				</ol>
